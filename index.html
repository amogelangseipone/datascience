(4)
Integrated means the warehouse is a centralized, consolidated database that integrates data derived from the entire organization and from multiple sources with diverse formats. []
Subject-oriented means the data are arranged and optimized to provide answers to questions coming from diverse functional areas and are summarized by topic. []
Time variant means warehouse data represent the flow of data through time. 
Non-volatile means the data is never removed once it enters the warehouse.</p>

        <h2>2.15–2.23: Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>You must ensure that the data that is loaded into warehouse is high-quality, accurate, relevant, useful and accessible []. Extraction takes pre-selected data fields from a number of sources[] ready for transformation and loading into the warehouse. Data can be operational, historical, internal or external. []
Once the data has been determined, each selected attribute must be mapped into the data warehouse []. Aims to eliminate any data anomalies [] found in the extracted data. Scrubs (cleans) the data and standardizes it. []
Data is moved into the data warehouse. []First load time takes place once and is used to initially load historical data. Thereafter the data must be refreshed []</p>

            cloud implementation types: 
            Public cloud []
– Built by a third-party organization to sell cloud services to the public []
• Private cloud []
– Internal cloud built by an organization for the sole purpose of servicing its own needs []
• Community cloud []
– Built by and for a specific group of organizations that share a common trade []</p>

    <p> types of cloud services 
    </p>
        <p>
            Software as a service [] – the service provider offers turnkey applications that run in the cloud []. The client can run the applications internally [] and customise certain aspects of the applications but cannot make changes to the application itself []. Platform as a service [] – the service provider offers the capability to build and deploy consumer created applications using the provider’s cloud infrastructure []. The client can build, deploy and manage applications using the provider’s tools, languages and interfaces [].
Infrastructure as a service [] – the service provider offers the ability to provision their own resources on demand []. The consumer can add or remove the resources as needed [].
