        <p>Integrated, subject-oriented, time-variant, and nonvolatile collection of data.
(4)
Integrated means the warehouse is a centralized, consolidated database that integrates data derived from the entire organization and from multiple sources with diverse formats. []
Subject-oriented means the data are arranged and optimized to provide answers to questions coming from diverse functional areas and are summarized by topic. []
Time variant means warehouse data represent the flow of data through time. 
Non-volatile means the data is never removed once it enters the warehouse.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p> Data marts is Small, single-subject data warehouse subset

    <section id="preprocessing">
        <h2>2.15–2.23: Preprocessing</h2>
        <p>You must ensure that the data that is loaded into warehouse is high-quality, accurate, relevant, useful and accessible []. Extraction takes pre-selected data fields from a number of sources[] ready for transformation and loading into the warehouse. Data can be operational, historical, internal or external. []
Once the data has been determined, each selected attribute must be mapped into the data warehouse []. Aims to eliminate any data anomalies [] found in the extracted data. Scrubs (cleans) the data and standardizes it. []
Data is moved into the data warehouse. []First load time takes place once and is used to initially load historical data. Thereafter the data must be refreshed []</p>

        <p>Three main characteristics of OLAP:
Multidimensional data analysis techniques
Advanced database support
Easy-to-use end-user interfaces
Support client/server architecture
</p>
        <p>Cloud computing services is A computing model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computer resources (networks, servers, storage)

            cloud implementation types: 
            Public cloud []
– Built by a third-party organization to sell cloud services to the public []
• Private cloud []
– Internal cloud built by an organization for the sole purpose of servicing its own needs []
• Community cloud []
– Built by and for a specific group of organizations that share a common trade []</p>

            characteristics of cloud services:
            Ubiquitous access via Internet technologies
Shared infrastructure
Lower costs and variable pricing
Flexible and scalable services
Dynamic provisioning
Service orientation
Managed operations</p>

    <p> types of cloud services 
    </p>
        <p>
            Software as a Service (SaaS)
Cloud service provider offers turnkey applications that run in the cloud
Consumers can run the provider’s applications internally in their organizations via the Web or any mobile device
Consumers can customize aspects of the application
Application is actually shared among users from multiple organizations

        </p>
        <p>
            Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Cloud service provider offers the capability to build and deploy consumer created applications using the provider’s cloud infrastructure
Consumer can build, deploy and manage applications using the provider’s cloud tools
Consumer does not manage the underlying infrastructure

        </p>
        <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Cloud service provider offers consumers the ability to provision their own resources on demand, including storage, servers, database
 </p>
        <p> advantages of cloud services
        Low initial cost of entry
Scalability
Support for mobile computing
Ubiquitous access
High reliability and performance
Fast provisioning
Managed infrastructure</p>

        <p>disadvantages
        Issues of security, privacy and compliance
Hidden costs of implementation and operation
Data migration is a difficult and lengthy process
Complexing licensing schemes
Loss of ownership and control
Organization culture
Difficult integration with internal IT system</p>
